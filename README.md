# gwmbl
**gwmbl** is an experiment in writing a relatively simple window manager in Go using xcb/xproto. At the moment it has the basics of window borders, window move (lmb), resize (rmb), and focusing on lmb release with no move.

It will probably be enhanced to be a reparenting WM to support more modern programs, potentially event using net wm features.
